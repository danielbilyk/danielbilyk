### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dani.

<!--
**danielbilyk/danielbilyk** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª I live in Munich, Germany.
- ðŸŽ“ I'm finishing up political science bachelor at Technical University of Munich.
- ðŸ‘¨ Three years ago all the "code" I wrote in my life was at the HTML class at school. Since I started at TUM, I got extremely interested and passionate about technology, and started using R and Python in Computational Social Science classes.
- ðŸŒš I'm at that phase of my code-writing endeavour where I will do anything just to see if I can do it. I don't yet have the confidence in figuring the stuff out of people who've been doing it for a long time. Nor am I looking at tehc as a tired pessimist: I can't do anything, so I'm excited to try any shit to see if I can do it.
- ðŸ¤– As of right now, I'm mostly preoccupied with automating stuff on my Raspberry Pi for 8 hours straight, instead of doing it manually in 3 seconds. As I said, everyone went trough this phase, but I didn't yet. What keeps me excited apart from breaking all the loosely joined little pieces on Raspbian, are Telegram bots for personal usage. I'm using bots for gags and saving favourite stickers.
